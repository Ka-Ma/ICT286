        <p class = "text">Romeo and Juliette embraced their love of fiction and opened 'Books Matters, Mann!' in 199$
        and it has been a family business ever since. Romeo and Juliette were both avid readers, seeking to read
        as many books, from as wide a variety of genres as they could. After many years of fulfilling this dream,
        they came up with another dream. To share the wonderful world of fiction with as many people as they
        could. 17 years down the track and 'Books Matters, Mann!' is still fulfilling this dream. BMM is a small
        business with a big heart. BMM provides homes for both new and used books. All of our used books are
        traded to us by our loyal customers in exchange for credits, which they can use online or in store to
        purchase from our wide range of books. We also stock new books from a diverse range of authors so that they
        too may find a welcoming home. BMM is also a proud donator of used books to local schools, where
        students of all ages may enjoy the stories they have to tell. For every 10 books that are purchased
        from BMM, online or in store, we donate 1 used book to a public school. Over 4000 books have already been
        generously donated to this date. Our staff members all share Romeo and Juliette's love for books and their
        dream to share the world of fiction. It is through their hard work and dedication that BMM is still able
	to continue striving to fulfill this wonderful dream. </p>
